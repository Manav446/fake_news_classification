# Fake News Classification using DistilBERT

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a Fake News Classification project utilizing the DistilBERT model from scratch, built entirely with PyTorch. 

## Project Overview

In the era of misinformation, distinguishing between real and fake news is crucial. This project aims to address this challenge by leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify news articles as either real or fake. 

## Key Features

- **Custom Model Architecture**: Every component of the model, including tokenization, embedding, and classification layers, has been implemented manually, providing a deep understanding of the underlying mechanics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes thorough data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure high-quality input for the model.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Comprehensive training loop with validation metrics, allowing for effective monitoring of model performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track accuracy and loss during training and validation to gauge the model's effectiveness.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the installation section. Detailed usage examples are provided to help you understand how to run the model and make predictions.
